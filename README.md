### Academic_Satisfaction_model

The Academic_Satisfaction_model is a model that determines the overall satisfaction of students based on eight parameters. These parameters include Quality of teaching, Course content, Course organization, Resources and facilities, Assessments and feedback, Student engagement, Learning outcomes, and Support services. Each parameter is rated by the student on a scale of 1 to 5.

The model calculates the overall satisfaction grade by taking the average of the ratings provided by the student for each parameter. The grade ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest level of satisfaction and 5 being the highest level of satisfaction.

The model helps educational institutions identify areas where they can improve the student experience and increase student satisfaction. This can lead to higher retention rates, better academic outcomes, and a more positive reputation for the institution.

In summary, the Academic_Satisfaction_model is a useful tool for measuring student satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement in educational institutions.
